Data Hiding in C
--------------------

lib variables are protected, use laways setter/getter api's

``struct test`` is not known to ``main.c`` and ``main.h``

main.c/h knows only ``Test``. main.h declares Test as ``typedef struct test Test``, but not aware of ``struct test``.

But lib.c aware of bith ``Test`` and ``struct test``, hence struct variables can be accessed inside lib.c.
Hence main.c cannot access members of Test.
