Creating Static Library:
Library file is "static.c"

create a headerfile with the prototypes of the API's present in static.c
and name it as "static.h"

create the object file of static.c
gcc -c static.c -o static.o

for multiple files, create .o files separately then
with all .o files create a single .a file

crates libstatic.a static library file
Here prefix "lib" and suffix ".a" is must
lib<your library name>.a
ar rcs libstatic.a static.o

crate a main file by including static.h
gcc main.c -L. -lstatic -o main.out

this will give us the executable
