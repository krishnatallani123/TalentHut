* You just need followings to start:
	. STM32F4 Discovery Board
	. USB Mini Cable
	. Keil uVision5 Software (From the link below, go to the Download -> Product Downloads -> MDK-ARM). 
		After you enter your contact information there you can download the program.
		link: https://www.keil.com/
	.STM32 ST-Link Utility
		This is the utility used to flash the hex/bin to stm-controller
		From the link below, from Get Software you should give your full name and email information.
		Then you will get a mail that contains a download link.

* Before you install your driver LED (PWR LED) will turn on red stable and another LED (COM LED) will blink red.

* After you install st-link_v2_usbdriver, update your driver.
	Device Manager -> Other devices -> STM32 STLink
	Right click and Update Driver Software… and choose Search automatically for updated driver software
	After updating, driver will be shown in Universal Serial Bus controllers or Universal Serial Bus devices 
	as a STMicroelectronics STLink dongle
	Now the COM LED won’t be blink and will be stable red as PWR LED.

* Install Keil uVersion5.

* Open the Keil uVersion5.

* The keil contains some example project to confirm the setup environment.
	First disable the Read-only protection of the Projects Folder.
	Keil_v5 -> ARM -> Pack -> Keil -> STM32F4xx_DFP -> [Pack Version (for example 2.8.0) ] -> Right click on Projects Folder and go to 		Properties uncheck Read-only and confirm the changes to the subfolders and files.

* Now in Keil uVision5 open your example project. Project -> Open Project…
	Keil_v5 -> ARM -> Pack -> Keil -> STM32F4xx_DFP -> [Pack Version (for example 2.8.0) ] -> Projects -> STM32F4-Discovery -> Examples -> 		GPIO -> GPIO_EXTI -> MDK-ARM -> Project (Green Icon File)

* Goto Flash tab in keil and Configure Flash Tool...
	
* From Target tab set Xtal (MHz) up to 8.0

* In Debug tab use ST-Link Debugger.

* In Utilities tab uncheck Use Debug Driver and choose ST-Link Debugger

* In Utilities tab, Configure Flash Menu Command, open settings and make sure that in Flash Download tab for 
	Programming Algorithm you’ve added STM32F4xx Flash.

* Debug tab for Debug Adapter unit ST-Link/V2 is already chosen (whn your board is connected to your PC) and the Port is SW.

* Now open main.c from Example/User Folder in the Project toolbar in the left side.Build you project by pressing F7 or the icon. 
	And Load it to your board by pressing F8 or the icon.

* while you are loading your project the LD1 LED on your board will blink red and green repeatedly.
	It shows that the project is loading to your board.

* If all the processes gone correctly you will see the these messages in Build Output window in the bottom.
	Programming Done.
	Verify OK.
	Flash Load Finished At xx:xx:xx

* By pressing the Blue Button on your board you can see the 4 LEDs (between the Black Button and Blue Button)turning on and off.

* This confirms that your setup is ready.

For New Project.....
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* In Keil goto Project Tab->New uVision Project..

* Provide the path(Location where you need to save the project) and file name, click Save.

* A Select Device For Target 'Target 1'... will open.
	Select your device from list by pressing + in list (+ ARM, + STMicroelectronics)

* Then Press OK.

* Manage Run-Time Environment window will open. Select the needed drivers.
	while selecting if you get orange colour, press Resolve below to add dependencies.

* Press OK.

* Now you will be Redirected to Keil Project.

* If you want to add some more drivers goto Run-Time Environment by pressing Icon(green square with 4 black dots) in Keil toolbar.
