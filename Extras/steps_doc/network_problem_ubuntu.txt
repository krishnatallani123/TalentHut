Networking not working in Ubuntu whenever I update libnl-3*

This is common when you work with wpa_supplicant.
wpa_supplicant requires libnl-3* libraries.
If you update to libnl-3*, network-manager will ot work.
Because of lower version of network-manager.

solution is downgrade libnl3 or upgrade network-manager.

Best solution which I did is,
remove the libnl-3* libraries ex:libnl-3-200 libnl-genl-3-200 libnl-route-3-200 etc.

[unable to access the system may be sudo or root problem, them use live cd for the same.]
i.e
boot the system with live ubuntu cd.
goto try ubuntu.
mount the linux,
	  sudo fdisk -l
	  copy the  linux device may be sda1
	  sudo mkdir /mnt/temp
	  sudo mount sda1 /mnt/temp
	  cd /mnt/temp
	  sudo rm -rf libnl-*

Reboot the system.
remove the cd.
press enter once you remove the cd as is poped up on screen
