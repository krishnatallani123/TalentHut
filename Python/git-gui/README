## This is hoby PyQt5 programming.

## Aim:
Making gui for git basic operations like `status`, `log`, `diff`, `add`, `commit with --amend` and `push`.

This will work only if you are running this file from git repo.

Clone the repo and run `./git_gui.py`
You can select the git operation in the GUI.
